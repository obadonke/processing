An exploration of the Processing language

== Notes
As of 25th January 2016, I've started reading the *Nature of Code* by Daniel Shiffman. You can find the book at http://natureofcode.com.

I am chipping away at the Nature of Code in my spare time. The book also indirectly introduced me to AsciiDoc and Asciidoctor which you can find out more about here: http://asciidoctor.org.

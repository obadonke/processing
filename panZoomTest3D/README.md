## Background
The aim of this processing sketch is to construct a simple method of navigating a 3D scene using mouse or keyboard input. 

I'm developing the sketch in an adhoc  manner, just having a bit of fun coding in free time.

Chipping away at keyboard navigation. Mouse control isn't working.

## Keyboard Navigation Bindings
 * w = move up
 * s = move down
 * a = move left
 * d = move right
 * q = move forward
 * e = move back
 * r = zoom in (+)
 * f = zoom out (-)
 * j = roll anti-clockwise
 * l = roll clockwise
 * i = pitch up
 * k = pitch down
 * u = yaw left
 * o = yaw right

Note: zoom moves closer to the focal point. move fwd/back moves camera and focal point.

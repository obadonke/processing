rain drop obstacles.

Only one at a time.
If the first time a rain drop encounters an obstacle it is already inside it, it ignores the obstacle.
the drop has to be about to cross the boundary of an obstacle for it to count. It then keeps a reference to the obstacle until it's passed it.

to stay relatively encapsulated, only interaction should be to know if boundary crossed and what angle of incidence to the tangent is.
